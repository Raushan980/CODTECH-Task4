## Overview of the project

### Project:PROGRESSIVE WEB APPLICATION (PWA). 

### Objective:This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed for an e-commerce platform, enabling users to browse, shop, and receive updates even when they are offline or on unstable networks. The app combines the power of React.js, Service Workers, and the Cache API to deliver a smooth, mobile-first shopping experience.

### Key Features

Add items to the shopping cart and review before checkout.

**Offline Access (PWA Core Feature)**

Utilizes a Service Worker to cache static files (index.html, JS bundles, etc.).

Ensures the core app shell is accessible offline.

**Push Notifications**

Uses the Push API to deliver notifications (e.g., sale alerts or order updates).

Displayed via the browser’s native notification system.

**Responsive Design**

Built with mobile-first principles for a seamless experience across devices.

Styled with CSS frameworks like Tailwind or custom responsive layouts.

**Persistent Experience**

Remembers shopping cart state and allows session continuity.

Can be installed to a user’s home screen like a native app.
